This file shows the inner workings of the non-linear programming solver package.
Each step is recorded and displayed here.

This is iteration 1:

The initial point is: [0.0, 0.0]
The initial search directions for each variable are: [4.0, 0.0]
The initial lambda/alpha is: 0.5
The new point is: [2.0, 0.0]


The minimum of the function x1**2 - 2*x1*x2 - 4*x1 + 3*x2**2 is found at:
x1 = 2.00
x2 = 0.00
