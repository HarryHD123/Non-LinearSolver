This file shows the inner workings of the non-linear programming solver package.
Each step is recorded and displayed here.

This is iteration 1:

The initial point is: [0.0, 0.0]
The initial search directions for each variable are: [-1.0, 1.0]
The initial lambda/alpha is: 1.0
The new point is: [-1.0, 1.0]

Beta Values are calculated using the Polak-Ribiere method.

This is iteration 2:

This iteration starts from: [-1.0, 1.0]
The search directions for each variable are: [0.0, 2.0]
Beta is: 1.0
Alpha is: 0.25
The new point is: [-1.0, 1.5]

The minimum of the function 2*x1**2 + 2*x1*x2 + x1 + x2**2 - x2 is found at:
x1 = -1.00
x2 = 1.50
