DESCRIPTION:
This program is designed to solve non-linear programing problems using the conjugate gradient method to find
the minimum of a function.

USAGE:.
The program is controlled by changing the Function variable at the top of the script in the User Input section.

A number of other variables under the user input section affect the running of the code, however, each has a
default value set.

The answer and workings are printed in log.txt and output.txt.

This program requires Sympy to be installed to run. The inbuilt Python module Time is also used.
